# ANALYSIS-OF-STREAMING-SERVICE-DATASET-SUPERVISED-AND-UNSUPERVISED-LEARNING-TECHNIQUES-

This study explores customer behavior in streaming services by applying advanced machine
learning techniques to a publicly available dataset. The goal was to predict monthly
spending, determine the likelihood of churn, and segment customers based on their
behavior. Predictive models, including regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random
Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), were used to evaluate both numerical and
categorical features, various predictive models were employed. Additionally, clustering
techniques such as k-Means and Hierarchical Clustering were utilized to uncover spending
patterns within the data. The results demonstrated that multiple linear regression, when
applied to all numerical features along with encoded categorical features, achieved the
highest predictive accuracy, with an RÂ² score of 0.8861. For churn prediction, Random Forest
outperformed KNN and SVM, achieving the best metrics. Unsupervised learning through k-
Means clustering revealed two distinct customer segments, validated using Davies-Bouldin
and Silhouette Scores. These findings provide actionable insights for streaming service
providers to enhance customer retention and tailor their offerings.
